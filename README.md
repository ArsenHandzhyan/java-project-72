## Project Description

This project is an analysis tool designed for SEO optimization. It allows users to enter the name of a website (and optionally specify a port) on the main page (`/`), after which they are redirected to the `/urls` page where the entered site is displayed. Users can create checks for each added site, which involve parsing the HTML body of the site. Upon completion of a check, users can view the response code and a list of HTML tag values. The `/urls` page displays the dates of the last checks and the response code for each site.
